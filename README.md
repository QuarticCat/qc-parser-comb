# QC Parser Comb (WIP)

A header-only parser combinator library for fun. Aiming to be simple and elegant.

## Requirements

Since this is just a toy project, I am not going to put too much effort on compatibility. But it should work well under following requirements:

- C++ 20
- x86-64
- GCC >= 10.2 or Clang >= 11.0
- CMake >= 3.19
- Google Test >= 1.10 (optional)
